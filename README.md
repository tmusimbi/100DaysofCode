# 100DaysofCode
Challenge to code for 100 Days for at least an hour a Day

A New #100DaysOfCode for a New Year
First things first, if you rise to the to the #100DaysOfCode challenge, here’s what you’re committing to:

1. I will code for at least an hour every day.

2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and note which day of the challenge I’m on.

3. I will fork the #100DaysOfCode repository to my GitHub account, then track my progress there

4. If I code as part of my job, I will not count that time towards the challenge.

5. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials.

6. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter.

7. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
