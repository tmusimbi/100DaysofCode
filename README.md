# 100DaysofCode
Challenge to code for 100 Days for at least an hour a Day
A New #100DaysOfCode for a New Year
First things first, if you rise to the to the #100DaysOfCode challenge, here’s what you’re committing to:
I will code for at least an hour every day.
I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
I will fork the #100DaysOfCode repository to my GitHub account, then track my progress there
If I code as part of my job, I will not count that time towards the challenge.
I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. (If you’re new to coding, Free Code Camp’s curriculum quickly ramps up to building projects, and you will have built dozens of projects by the time you finish it).
I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter.
I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
